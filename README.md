## Description 

The employee directory app uses react to dynaically update the DOM. This application allows the user to view all employees, sort by employee, and sort alphabetically by employee name or numerically by employee id. 

This app highlights the value of components in react and why it is useful to set up applications with may components so they can easily be reused.
